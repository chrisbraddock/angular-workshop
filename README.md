angular-workshop
================

Let's start working with Angular!

This repo is designed to be a starting point for an angular workshop used to teach the basics of Angular in a practical manner.

## Getting Started

To begin working with this repo, you will need grunt and stylus installed.

- `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- `npm install -g stylus`

Once you have cloned the repo and have those 2 dependencies installed, simply run the following from the project root directory.

- `npm install`

Then you can run `grunt dev` to start the development environment.

## Agenda
1. ~~Wire up newItem to itemList~~
2. ~~Change list to use an array of objects~~
3. ~~Use object properties to drive style~~
4. ~~Allow user to mark item as done~~
5. ~~Load initial data list from JSON file~~
6. ~~Save state to localStorage after initial load~~
7. ~~Show more text when hovering over item (using controller/directive)~~
8. ~~Move item list code to a directive~~
